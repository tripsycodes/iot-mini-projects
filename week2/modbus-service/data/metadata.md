Soil parameters of following three locations in IITP Campus:
1. Sports Complex 
    Time: 19:21 ~ 19:36
    Date: 06-02-26

2. Landfill/Compost past Canal Bridge
    Time: 17:55 ~ 18:08
    Date: 07-02-26

3. Flower Array [Football Ground]
    Time: 18:28 ~ 19:00
    Date: 07-02-26

Note: In the .csv file, the timings are in seconds since unix epoch. Since raspberry pi was working remotely, the timings may not be synchronized to the real world timings. The data of the three locations can be seperated using discontinuity analysis on the `time`,`temperature` or other column, if it shows sufficient discontuinity.
